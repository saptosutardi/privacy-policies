        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "AmalQ: Ladang Amal" application handles data. Our application is designed as a personal habit and worship tracking tool that stores all data locally on your device. We are committed to maintaining your privacy and ensuring that no personal information is collected, stored on remote servers, or transmitted to third parties.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="section-number">1.</span> Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>AmalQ stores data locally on your device using <code>SharedPreferences</code> (mobile) and local storage mechanisms. The application collects and stores only the following information <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amal (Good Deeds) Records:</strong> Names, icons, colors, target days, and active status of habits you create</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Completion Records:</strong> Which habits were completed on specific dates and their completion timestamps</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Reset time, theme mode preference (light/dark/system), statistics display settings, and week configuration</li>
            <li><strong>Onboarding Status:</strong> Whether you have viewed the introductory guides</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Importantly:</strong> We do NOT collect personal identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or any demographic data.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="section-number">2.</span> No Remote Data Transmission</h2>
        <p>This application does <strong>not transmit, sync, or upload</strong> your data to any remote servers, cloud services, or external servers. All data remains entirely on your device. Your habit data is not shared with us, backup services, or any third party.</p>
        
        <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span> Data Security</h2>
        <p>Because the application is designed to store data locally and does not transmit information to external servers, the risk of data interception or breach through network transmission is eliminated. However, the security of data stored on your device depends on your device's security settings and screen lock protection. We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device locked with a strong PIN or biometric authentication</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Not sharing your device with untrusted individuals</li>
        </ul>
