<h1>Privacy Policy for Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid</h1>

<div class="meta-info">
    <p><strong>Application Name:</strong> Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid</p>
    <p><strong>Also known as:</strong> Carian Diare Pediatri (Indonesia)</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dr. Sapto Labs</p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 28, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 28, 2025</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the “Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid” application handles data. 
    Our application is designed as a fully offline tool that performs all calculations directly on your device.
    We are committed to maintaining your privacy and ensuring that no personal or medical information is collected,
    stored, or transmitted.
</p>

<h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    The application does not collect, record, store, or transmit any type of data. 
    All information entered into the app—including patient weight, dehydration status, or any other medical inputs—is processed 
    solely on your device and not shared with us or any third party.
</p>

<p><strong>Specifically, we do NOT collect:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
    <li>Patient or medical data</li>
    <li>Device identifiers, IP address, or location</li>
    <li>Analytics or usage activity</li>
    <li>Any information entered into the application</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data Security</h2>
<p>
    Because the application is fully offline and does not transmit data to external servers, the risk of data interception 
    or breach is eliminated. Any information entered is temporary and remains only in your device’s memory during the 
    active session.
</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>This application does not use or integrate with any third-party services, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising networks</li>
    <li>Analytics platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)</li>
    <li>Cloud storage</li>
    <li>Crash reporting systems</li>
    <li>Social media integrations</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Permissions</h2>
<p>
    The app does not request access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, storage, or any other personal data. 
    Only minimal permissions required by the operating system to run the app are used.
</p>

<h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
<div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This app is intended for healthcare professionals, medical trainees, and caregivers. 
    While it is used for pediatric medical calculations, it does not collect any data about children or any other individuals.</p>
</div>
<p>
    We comply with COPPA and other international child privacy regulations. Since no data is collected, there is no risk 
    of children's information being captured or stored.
</p>

<h2>6. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
    This application is a clinical decision-support tool and is <strong>not a substitute for professional medical judgment</strong>. 
    Healthcare providers remain fully responsible for all clinical decisions.
</p>
<p>
    The app does <strong>not</strong> diagnose, treat, or store medical records. It only provides calculation assistance 
    based on user input.
</p>

<h2>7. International Compliance</h2>
<p>This application complies with major global privacy regulations, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>GDPR (EU):</strong> No personal data is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> No data is sold or shared.</li>
    <li><strong>HIPAA (USA):</strong> The app does <strong>not</strong> store, process, or transmit Protected Health Information (PHI).</li>
    <li><strong>UU PDP 2022 (Indonesia):</strong> No personal data is processed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Open-Source Notice</h2>

    This application’s source code is publicly available on GitHub under the developer’s repository. 
    The privacy guarantees described in this document apply to the official version distributed by Dr. Sapto Labs. 
    If you download, modify, or compile the source code independently, the resulting privacy characteristics may differ 
    and are not the responsibility of the developer.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
    We retain no data. All user inputs are temporary and cleared when you exit or reset the application.
</p>

<h2>10. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
    Because we do not collect or store personal data, there is no data to access, modify, delete, or export. 
    You maintain full control over the information you input, which remains solely on your device.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
