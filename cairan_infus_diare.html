    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid</h1>
    
    <div class="meta-info">
        <p><strong>Application Name:</strong> Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid</p>
        <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dr. Sapto Labs</p>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 28, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 28, 2025</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy outlines our practices regarding data for the "Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid" application. Our core principle is to respect your privacy, and as such, our application is designed to be a completely offline tool that operates entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The "Pediatric Diarrhea Fluid" application is a standalone, offline tool. We do not collect, record, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information or any other data you enter into the application (such as patient weight, age, dehydration status, etc.). All calculations and data processing occur exclusively on your local device.</p>
    <p><strong>Specifically, we do NOT collect:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
        <li>Patient data or medical information</li>
        <li>Device identifiers or location data</li>
        <li>Usage statistics or analytics</li>
        <li>Any other information entered into the application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the application does not collect or store any data on external servers, there is no risk of your data being compromised or breached through network transmission. Any information you input is processed temporarily in your device's memory and is discarded once you close the application or clear the input fields.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This application does not integrate with any third-party services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)</li>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>
        <li>Crash reporting tools</li>
        <li>Cloud storage services</li>
        <li>Social media platforms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application operates completely independently and offline.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The application does not require any special device permissions (such as access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, or storage) to function. The app only requests the minimum permissions necessary for basic operation on Android devices.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This application is designed for use by healthcare professionals, medical students, and caregivers. While the application is used to calculate fluid therapy for pediatric patients (children), the app itself does not collect any information about children or any other users.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We are committed to protecting children's privacy and comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar international regulations. Since we do not collect any data whatsoever, including data about children, there is no risk of children's information being collected or misused through our application.</p>
    <p>Any patient data entered into the application (including information about children) is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Processed locally on your device only</li>
        <li>Never transmitted to any server</li>
        <li>Never stored permanently</li>
        <li>Automatically cleared when you exit the application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Users and Compliance</h2>
    <p>This application is available globally and complies with major privacy regulations, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - EU):</strong> We do not process any personal data, so GDPR data processing requirements do not apply.</li>
        <li><strong>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):</strong> We do not sell or share any personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):</strong> While this app is used for medical calculations, we do not collect, store, or transmit any protected health information (PHI).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not retain any data because we do not collect any data. All calculations and inputs are processed in real-time on your device and are not stored beyond the current session.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, correct, delete, or transfer. You maintain complete control over any information you enter into the application, as it never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date</li>
        <li>Providing notice through the application (if technically feasible)</li>
        <li>Updating the policy on the Google Play Store listing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
