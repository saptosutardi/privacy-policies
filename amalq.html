    <h1>Kebijakan Privasi</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: January 2, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>AmalQ: Ladang Amal</strong> ("Application") is developed by <strong>Dr. Sapto Labs</strong> as a Free app.
        This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        For a better experience while using our Service, we assure you that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Sent to Server:</strong> The application operates entirely offline (local). We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data (such as name, email, location, or worship records) to any external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data you enter (such as a list of practices, daily checklist history, and theme preferences) is stored locally in your device's memory using internal storage technology (SharedPreferences).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Log</h2>
    <p>
        We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app, the device’s operating system may collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This data is used solely for technical purposes of application improvement (debugging).
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        This application does not explicitly use "cookies". However, the application may use third-party code and libraries (such as Android's built-in Google Mobile Services) that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. Since this application is local, this usage is very minimal.
    </p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>
        This application is built using the Flutter framework. The application does not use third-party services that actively track or personally identify users for advertising or marketing analytics purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information (worship records). Since data is stored locally on your device, the security of data relies heavily on the physical security of your device (e.g., using a screen lock or password on your phone). Remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and We cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case We discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, We immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that We will be able to do necessary actions.
This service is safe to use for all ages, including children, as it does not collect any personal data and does not display inappropriate content.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
